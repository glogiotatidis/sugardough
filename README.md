Opinions
--------

* If you want to change the rules for **PEP8**, go and edit the `setup.cfg` file.

* If you want to use **MySQL** instead of PostgreSQL (which is default),
edit the generated `requirements.txt` file and remove the lines about
`psycopg2` then use `peep` to add the version of `MySQL-python` you want to
use. You will also need to edit the `.travis.yml` file accordingly.

* If you don't want to use **Jinja2**, remove the lines about `jingo`,
`MarkupSafe` and `Jinja2` in the `requirements.txt` file. You will
also need to edit the file `settings/base.py` and remove the
`TEMPLATE_LOADERS` setting.

* if you want to use **pytest instead of nose**, remove `nose` and
`django-nose` from `requirements.txt` then add in `pytest`, `py`,
`cov-core` and `pytest-django` instead.
For test coverage you'll also have to add `pytest-cov`.
Next you'll need to edit the `.travis.yml` file and edit the script part.
Instead of `coverage run manage.py test` it
`py.test --cov=sugardough`.
